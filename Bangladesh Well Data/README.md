# Data Analysis Class Project (2018 Fall) - Policy Implementation with Bangladesh Well Data

## Problem
Arsenic levels in wells can prove to be fatal to villagers who mainly get their water from wells. This is a growing problem in Bangladesh, where 
many households face threats to water safety. The data contains results of safety on 50,000 + households. By analyzing this data set, our goal is to 
identify what factors are   We have narrowed down the problem to answer two main questions:

1) Does arsenic poisoning lead to impoverishment by increasing expenses on healthcare? And does this vary by region? 
2) What factors affect well switching behaviors among households that have arsenic in the wells? What are some 
   policy implementations that could increase well switching among the affected people?
