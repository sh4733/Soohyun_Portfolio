# California Employment Discrimination Analysis

I have not included the discrimination case data since the research is still ongoing, and has not yet been publicly released.

The project can be divided into 3 parts: 

1) Address data cleaning & Geocoding
2) Socioeconomic variables dataset building with US Census public database 
3) Identification of corresponding companies from statewide company data through near-duplicate matching

## Address data cleaning & Geocoding

## Socioeconomic variables dataset building

## Near-duplicate matching algorithm
